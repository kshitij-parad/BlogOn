I understand that the `README.md` might not meet your expectations—perhaps it’s too plain, lacks visual appeal, or doesn’t emphasize key aspects you’d like highlighted. Since this is for a GitHub-style Markdown file, I’ll enhance it with better formatting, badges, concise sections, and a cleaner look, while keeping it functional and paste-ready. Here’s an improved version based on your project details:
